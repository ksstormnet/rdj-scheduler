# Testing Standards and Framework

## Test Framework Architecture

1. Core Components
- test-framework.sh provides testing infrastructure
- run-tests.sh orchestrates test execution
- Individual test files implement specific tests
- Clean test environment management

2. Assertion Functions
- assert: Basic condition testing with detailed output
- assert_equals: Value comparison with difference reporting
- assert_contains: String containment verification
- assert_matches: Regex pattern matching

3. Test Organization
- Tests mirror source structure
- One test file per component
- Tests grouped by functionality
- Independent test environments

4. Test Environment Management
- setup_test_environment: Initialize clean state
- begin_test_group: Group related tests
- cleanup_test_environment: Clean resources
- Automatic test counting and reporting

## Test Implementation

1. Test File Structure
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#######################################
# [Component] Tests
# Last Updated: [Date]
#
# Test suite for [component description]
#######################################

cd "${PROJECT_ROOT}" || exit 1

test_specific_feature() {
    begin_test_group "Feature Name"
    
    assert "Description" "condition" "detail"
    assert_equals "Compare" "expected" "actual"
    assert_contains "Find" "haystack" "needle"
}

main() {
    setup_test_environment "Component Tests"
    test_specific_feature
    cleanup_test_environment
}

main
```

2. Best Practices
- Group related tests logically
- Use descriptive test names
- One assertion per test case
- Proper setup and cleanup
- Meaningful failure messages
- Test both success and failure cases

3. Resource Management
- Create temporary files safely
- Clean up all resources after tests
- Handle errors gracefully
- Maintain test isolation
- Use framework cleanup hooks

## Test Categories

1. Unit Tests
- Individual component testing
- Function-level verification
- Isolated environments
- Mock external dependencies

2. Integration Tests
- Component interaction testing
- Subsystem verification
- Database integration
- Error handling

3. System Tests
- End-to-end workflows
- Performance testing
- Error recovery
- Load testing

## Test Coverage Requirements

1. Core Functionality
- All public functions
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- Performance requirements

2. Test Environment
- Clean setup/teardown
- Resource isolation
- Error trapping
- State verification
